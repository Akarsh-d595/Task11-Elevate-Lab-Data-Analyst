# Task 11: A/B Testing — Hypothesis Testing in Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **A/B Testing** using statistical hypothesis testing techniques in Python.  
The goal is to compare a **control group** and a **test group** to determine whether a change leads to a statistically significant improvement in performance metrics such as conversion rate or mean value.

This task demonstrates the ability to make **data-driven business decisions** using statistical analysis.

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Approach
1. Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
2. Identify **control** and **test** groups.
3. Define hypotheses:  
   - **H0 (Null Hypothesis):** No significant difference between groups  
   - **H1 (Alternative Hypothesis):** Significant difference exists
4. Set significance level (**α = 0.05**).
5. Calculate group-level metrics (mean / conversion rate).
6. Select the appropriate statistical test:
   - **t-test** for numerical metrics  
   - **Chi-square test** for categorical/conversion data
7. Run the statistical test and extract the **p-value**.
8. Interpret results based on the p-value.
9. Calculate the **confidence interval** for the difference.
10. Visualize group distributions.
11. Provide a final decision with a **business recommendation**.
